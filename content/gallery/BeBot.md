### Chatbot

A chatbot is an application that provides a virtual environment to communicate with users.
Many companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Reliance, and so on are making use of these chatbots
to have effective conversations with their customers. The bot that we have developed is mainly
centralized in providing various career options for an individual after his/her UG. Our bot is
focused on serving small scale companies with not enough infrastructure to serve frequently
asked questions (FAQs) to their customers through our platform.
